japanese tariffs seen as worldwide warning the tough trade sanctions president reagan imposed on japanese exports are not only a shot across japan s bow but also a sign reagan will attack unfair trade practices worldwide u s officials said but robert crandall a trade specialist at brookings institution a think tank said a shot across their bow can often result in a shot in our stern he said it left the united states open to retaliation the u s officials said the pct tariffs reagan ordered on mln dlrs worth of japanese goods will also show congress that a tough pro trade stand can be taken under existing laws and no new protectionist legislation is needed in the past year tough trade action had been taken against the european community over corn and sorghum taiwan over beer and wine south korea over counterfeiting of copyrights patents and trademarkets and japan on tobacco white house spokesman marlin fitzwater told reporters the tariffs up from five pct should be seen as a serious signal to other nations on the need for fair trade practices reagan said he imposed the sanctions on certain computers television sets and some hand tools because japan did not honor an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at less than cost and to open its markets to u s products the tariffs were placed on items which were available from other sources so there would be little effect on the american consumer fitzwater said reagan has come under heavy pressure to take tougher action especially against japan to end global unfair trade practices and reverse the growing u s trade deficit the alternative was that if he did not congress would the u s trade gap last year was a record billion dlrs and continues to rise with japan accounting for about one third of america s overall deficit but there are other two way deficits with canada west germany taiwan and south korea and reagan officials said the president is ready to fight them all reagan said in announcing the sanctions today that i regret that these actions are necessary but that the health and vitality of the u s semiconductor industry was essential to american competitiveness in world markets we cannot allow it to be jeopardized by unfair trading practices reagan added in the statement from his california vacation home at santa barbara he said the tariffs would remain in force until japan abided by the agreement u s officials say the action today will show congress which is about to write a trade bill he does not like that he already has the tools needed to fight unfair trade the white house aide said of the tariff action it wasn t done to appease congress but because there was an unfair trade practice the aide added however on another plane it was an example of how the administration uses the trade law to fight unfair practices an that it is not necessary to make a major overall of our trade laws but the analyst crandall said the tariff action was not in the best interests of the united states and that negotiations should have been pursued to resolve the issue it s very dangerous to go down the retaliatory route he said because it leads to more retaliation and restrictions in trade crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated crandall said the administration is doing this for its political impact across the country and therefore its impact on congress he said i don t think it makes a lot of sense but other analysts said it made little difference whether the tariffs were aimed at u s trading partners or congress and that the main point was that the trading partners were on notice that retaliation was a weapon reagan was ready to use spokesman fitzwater said we don t want a trade war but the imposition of sanctions showed the united states would act when it had evidence that trade pacts were being violated reuter

u s study says tariffs and quotas could backfire the use of tariffs and quotas to reduce the flow of foreign goods into the united states will do little to cut the nation s swelling trade deficit a government study said in fact the federal trade commission ftc report said such protectionist policies could make u s products less competitive in the world marketplace by raising the cost of imported products that are re exported in different forms such policies are much more likely to hurt rather than help the productive capabilities of the u s economy it said the page report written by ftc economists john hilke and philip nelson blamed the rising trade shortfall which climbed to a record billion dlrs last year on shifting currency exchange rates and growing u s consumer demand other factors commonly blamed for the deficit such as foreign trade practices deteriorating u s industrial competitiveness high labour costs and government restrictions on mergers added little to the problem it said although each industry s competitiveness affects the level of imports and exports in that industry in general we find that there have been no significant industry specific changes affecting competitiveness that would explain the increase in the overall trade deficit the study said to the extent any government action is needed to deal with the trade deficits policies should focus on economy wide phenomena such as exchange rates and relative economic growth the ftc study said supporting its conclusion that broad based economic shifts were the cause of the increase in the trade deficit the report said it found that nearly all u s industries lost some domestic market share to foreign competitors in the s it also said it found a fairly direct relationship between the increased trade deficit and the influence of shifting currency exchange rates u s economic growth and domestic demand for goods and services which has outpaced foreign consumer demand the study examined seven factors which have been commonly blamed for the trade deficit foreign government subsidies and trade barriers to protect foreign industries a lack of investment in u s industry declining research and development in u s industry high labour costs union work rules the oil prices rises of the s and u s antitrust regulations in each case the study found little or no evidence that the factor had any impact on the trade deficit reuter

opec differentials not seen posing major problems some opec states are unhappy about the prices assigned to their crude oil but this should not pose great problems when the group reviews its six month old price and output pact in vienna next week oil analysts say they said nigeria which holds the opec conference presidency and qatar probably have the biggest grievances about price differentials making some of their crudes uncompetitive there has also been speculation by japanese traders that opec might want to mark up prices of high sulphur heavy crudes to correspond with greater demand and higher fuel oil prices but most experts agree that a major overhaul of price differentials is unlikely so as to avoid giving the market signals of a dent in opec s new unity all opec members can make a good case for changing differentials said one analyst with a major oil company but at the end of the day the attitude is going to be leave well alone and little or nothing is likely to be altered iran libya and saudi arabia are among those who also saw sales problems earlier this year traders say but diminished customer resistance to fixed prices and in some cases marketing incentives have helped their sales some producers can sell uncompetitively priced crudes by means of discounts processing deals or selling them alongside better priced grades in a package many opec crudes are seen to be reasonably priced at least for some part of the year but many experts say opec should change prices quarterly or monthly to match seasonal demand for fuel oil rich heavy crudes and gasoline rich lighter grades at its last meeting in december opec agreed to reintroduce fixed prices from february around an dlr per barrel reference point official prices had been effectively dropped in when members offered discounts to attract customers opec also decided to limit first half output to mln bpd and proposed ceilings of mln for the third quarter and mln for the fourth analysts expect it will now extend or raise slightly the current ceiling for the coming months spot market and netback values for some crudes do not mirror official prices but opec will probably keep the dlr target and at most make minimal changes to differentials analysts say the dlr figure is based on a basket of six opec and one non opec crudes opec assigned prices to its other key export crudes with a dlr gap between the heaviest and lightest extra heavy crudes were among those left out industry estimates vary on the proportion of opec oil exports actually sold at official prices several experts say only one quarter to one third of the total in fact sells at official prices with some of the rest included in processing or barter deals or sold in the form of refined products problems with the new structure appeared earlier this year when some producers output fell due to customer reluctance to pay the new prices nigeria especially found its gasoline rich bonny light crude now opec s highest priced grade at dlrs a barrel was uncompetitive on the spot market against britain s brent in february and march nigeria s production shrank below its mln bpd opec quota spot prices have since revived due partly to seasonal demand for gasoline and its output has risen some experts feel bonny light is still overvalued and say its price should be cut by between cts to one dlr a barrel but mehdi varzi chief oil analyst with london s kleinwort grieveson securities doubts nigeria will actively push the differentials question in vienna it would not look good for opec unity if nigeria which holds the presidency raised the issue he said reuter
